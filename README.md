# Laravel Introduction

Welcome to the world of Laravel! This repository provides a brief introduction to Laravel, a popular PHP web framework.

## What is Laravel?

Laravel is a powerful, open-source PHP framework designed to make web development enjoyable and efficient. It follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern and comes with features like Eloquent ORM, Blade templating engine, and a rich set of tools for tasks like routing, caching, and more.

## Getting Started

To get started with Laravel, follow these steps:

1. **Installation:** Install PHP, Composer, and Laravel on your machine.

    ```bash
    composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel my-laravel-app
    ```

2. **Explore the Structure:** Laravel has a well-organized directory structure. Key folders include `app` for your application code, `routes` for defining routes, and `resources` for views and assets.

3. **Artisan Commands:** Laravel comes with Artisan, a command-line tool. Run `php artisan` to see the available commands. Common commands include `php artisan serve` to start a development server.

4. **Configuration:** Configure your database connection and other settings in the `.env` file.

5. **Routing:** Define routes in the `routes/web.php` file. Learn about basic routing and controller usage.

6. **Views:** Explore Blade templating for creating dynamic views.

7. **Models and Database:** Use Eloquent ORM to interact with databases. Define models in the `app` directory.

8. **Middleware:** Learn about middleware for filtering HTTP requests.
